<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ECMO Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO Equipment</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ECMO equipment market is categorized into two main types: VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO and VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO. VA ECMO supports patients with both cardiac and respiratory failure by providing oxygenated blood directly to the arterial system, essential for those with severe heart conditions. In contrast, VV ECMO is primarily used for patients with respiratory failure, removing deoxygenated blood and returning oxygenated blood to the venous system. Both types play crucial roles in life-saving interventions in critical care settings.</p></p>
